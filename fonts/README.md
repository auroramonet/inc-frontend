# Medodica Font Setup

The Medodica font requires manual download and installation:

1. Visit: https://www.1001fonts.com/medodica-font.html
2. Download the font files
3. Place these files in this directory:
   - Medodica-Regular.ttf
   - Medodica-Bold.ttf (optional)

Until the font files are added, the app will use 'Cinzel' as a fallback which has a similar art magazine aesthetic.
